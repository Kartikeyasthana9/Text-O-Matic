If you are not familiar with the above terms - don't worry. I will explain everything to you in the next lesson.  Each section of this course is an independent part (albeit based on the knowledge from the previous parts).  So if you feel that a particular topic from the given part is already familiar to you, feel free to skip it and move on to the next part (for example, if you feel that you already know Bootstrap well and you are only interested in learning MDB - do not hesitate to skip the part about Bootstrap and move on to the next lessons).  Remember, however, that all the topics covered in this course form a coherent whole. To fully use the potential of our ecosystem, you should be well versed in all these topics.
